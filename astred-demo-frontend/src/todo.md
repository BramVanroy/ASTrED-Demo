- implement checkboxes for both src and target to indicate whether or not they are tokenised. Do not allow for the correction of tokenisation (not worth the time and obstructrs user-friendliness). Either manual tokenisation or automatic, but not with tokenisation suggestions
- restart button (= refresh)
- SECTION: use tokenised data to suggest alignments which the user can then correct
- SECTION: visualisation of the results given the tokenised data
- make sections disappear (but still in DOM, just hidden) when filled in so that user does not get confused. Allow them to go back a step though.
